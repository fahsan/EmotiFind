Ada ran home after school. She was expecting a box from Grandma. Sure enough, when she opened the door, she saw a big brown box sitting on the table.
 
Grandma had a special way of sending love when she couldn't be there in person. Sometimes she sent boxes. Ada called them treasure chests. "Mom, come quick," Ada shouted. "I can't wait another minute to open the box."
 
When she opened the package, she found three little boxes wrapped up inside. There was also a note. "Each box will tell you a little story," Ada read. "I've sent you some things that belonged to your mother."
 
Ada found the smallest box and opened it. Inside was a beautiful glass horse. "Oh, Ada," her mother said, "that horse was from a collection I had. I always wanted a pony, but we lived in Chicago. I couldn't have a real pony." Her mother held the little statue in the palm of her hand. "This glass horse was named Captain."
