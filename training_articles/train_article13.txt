New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy has signed an executive order making data on gun
violence more accessible to the public.
The so-called &quot;Name and Shame&quot; order will cite the origin of a gun involved in a
crime. According to the state, approximately 80 percent of guns involved in crime
come from outside of New Jersey.
Now, New Jersey authorities will identify the origins of those guns involved in
crimes. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, who was elected to replace Republican
Chris Christie, touts the order as being in the public interest, saying in a
statement, &quot;Any death due to gun violence, is one death too many.&quot;

According to the order, department and state police would periodically publish
data on guns involved in crime and where they came from. This data is already
collected and open to the public via the FBI, but according Murphy, this law
would streamline the process. The first published data is expected next month.
Currently, New Jersey is ranked as having the third-toughest gun laws in the
nation, behind California and Connecticut, and is poising itself to pass more gun
legislation. The governor is also urging the Democratically-controlled legislature
to pass half a dozen gun-tightening measures for him to sign. Of the measure, one
would require people applying for a gun permit to demonstrate a &quot;justifiable
need.&quot;
If passed, New Jersey would be the third state to pass a comprehensive gun
package after the Parkland High School shooting that left 17 people dead,
following the footsteps of Florida and Vermont.
